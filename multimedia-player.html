            The map method is one of the most powerful and commonly used array methods in JavaScript. 
            It allows you to transform each element in an array and create a new array with the results. 
            The map method takes a callback function as an argument, and this callback function is executed 
            for each element in the array. The callback receives the current element, its index, and the 
            entire array as parameters. The map method then returns a new array containing the values 
            returned by the callback function for each element. It's important to note that the original 
            array remains unchanged - map creates a new array rather than modifying the existing one. 
            This makes it a pure function and a key tool in functional programming. Common use cases 
            include extracting specific properties from objects in an array, performing calculations 
            on numeric arrays, or formatting data for display. Understanding the map method is essential 
            for writing clean, declarative JavaScript code.
